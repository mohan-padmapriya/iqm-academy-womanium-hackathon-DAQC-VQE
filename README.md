- Challenge: Digital-analog Variational Quantum Eigensolver by IQM

This repository contains a solution for the DAQC VQE challenge for the Womanium Hackathon 2022.

In our solution, we implement a custom hamiltonian function and create an analog ansatz, which is combined with single qubit digital gates to give us an implementation of a digital-analog ansatz. We perfom VQE using this ansatz, and then evaluate its performancce with and without noise.
